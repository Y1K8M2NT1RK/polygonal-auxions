# Fixes Applied

## Issue 1: Duplicate Artworks in `/artworks` - FIXED ✅

**Problem**: Same artwork appearing multiple times in the artwork list during pagination.

**Root Cause**: When loading more artworks, the code was blindly appending new data without checking for duplicates that might have been returned due to query re-execution or network issues.

**Solution**: Added deduplication logic in `src/pages/artworks/index.tsx`:
- When appending new artworks during "Load More"
- Create a Set of existing artwork slug_ids
- Filter out any new artworks that already exist
- Only append truly unique artworks

## Issue 2: Search Clear Button - FIXED ✅

**Problem**: Search input lacked a clear button (×) for easy text removal.

**Solution**: Enhanced `src/components/SearchInput.tsx`:
- Added ClearIcon from Material-UI
- Added clear button that only appears when there's text in the search field
- Clear button clears input and navigates to `/artworks` (shows all artworks)
- Proper spacing and accessibility with aria-label
- Works on all device types (PC, tablet, smartphone)

Both fixes use minimal code changes and preserve all existing functionality.

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: Duplicate Artworks in `/artworks` - RESOLVED ✅

**Problem**: Multiple instances of the same artwork appearing in the artwork list when using pagination.

**Root Cause**: The pagination logic was blindly appending new artworks without checking for duplicates that could occur due to:
- Query re-execution during network issues
- Race conditions in state updates  
- Multiple rapid clicks on "Load More" button

**Solution in `src/pages/artworks/index.tsx`**:
```tsx
// Before (line 81-82):
// Load more - append new artworks
setAllArtworks(prev => [...prev, ...newArtworks]);

// After (line 81-87):
// Load more - append new artworks, but filter out duplicates
setAllArtworks(prev => {
  const existingIds = new Set(prev.map(artwork => artwork.slug_id));
  const uniqueNewArtworks = newArtworks.filter(artwork => !existingIds.has(artwork.slug_id));
  return [...prev, ...uniqueNewArtworks];
});
```

**Impact**: Users will no longer see duplicate artworks when scrolling through the artwork list, providing a better user experience.

### Issue 2: Search Clear Button Missing - RESOLVED ✅

**Problem**: Search input lacked a clear button (×) for easy text removal across all device types.

**Solution in `src/components/SearchInput.tsx`**:

1. **Added required imports**:
```tsx
import ClearIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Clear';
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
```

2. **Added clear functionality**:
```tsx
const router = useRouter();

const handleClear = () => {
  setSearchInput('');
  router.push('/artworks'); // Return to full artwork list
  if (onSearchIconClick) {
    onSearchIconClick(); // Close drawer on mobile if needed
  }
};
```

3. **Added conditional clear button**:
```tsx
{searchInput && (
  <IconButton 
    edge="end" 
    onClick={handleClear}
    size="small"
    sx={{ mr: 0.5 }}
    aria-label="検索をクリア"
  >
    <ClearIcon />
  </IconButton>
)}
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Only appears when there's text in the search field
- ✅ Proper Material-UI styling with accessibility label
- ✅ Works on PC, tablet, and smartphone
- ✅ Clears search and returns to full artwork list
- ✅ Integrates with existing mobile drawer functionality

**Visual Behavior**:
- When search field is empty: Only search icon (🔍) visible
- When user types: Both clear icon (×) and search icon (🔍) visible
- After clicking clear: Text cleared, navigates to `/artworks`, clear icon disappears
